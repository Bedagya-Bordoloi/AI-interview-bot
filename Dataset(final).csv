"). What is the purpose of garbage collection in Core Java, and when is it used?","Ans:- The main purpose of garbage collection is to analyze a program, identify and discard the objects that are no longer needed. It is helpful as the resources can be reclaimed and reused. A Core Java object is subjected to garbage collection when the object is not reachable to the program in which it is used.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What if the main() method is declared as private? What happens when the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main() method?,"Ans:- When the main() method is declared as private, the program compiles but during runtime it shows “main() method not public.” Message. When the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main() method, the Program compiles but at runtime throws an error “NoSuchMethodError”.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,AI Engineer,
). What is the first argument of the String array in the main() method?,"Ans:- Unlike in C/C++ where the first element by default is the program name, the string array in main() has no element, the String array is empty. When you enter the wave of coding, you shall notice such differences.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,AI Engineer,
). What is a Core Java servlet?,Ans:- A Servlet in Core Java refers to the server-side technologies which are used to extend the competence of web servers by giving it support for a dynamic response as well as data persistence.,https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,

). What’s the use of the transient keyword in Core Java?,"Ans: Java interview questions like this may appear difficult, but the concept is simple. The transient keyword in Java is a field modifier used to indicate that a field should not be included when the object is serialized into a byte stream. Fields marked as transient are excluded from the persistent storage and are particularly useful when certain fields contain sensitive or unnecessary data that don’t need to be saved during serialization. This ensures data privacy and reduces unnecessary storage.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is method overloading in Core Java?,"Ans: Basic Java interview questions like this one are a must-know for beginner developers who might want to try out Polymorphism. Method overloading in Java allows programmers to define two or more methods within the same class sharing the same name, as long as their parameter lists are different. This makes it easy for Java interview questions for freshers to expand APIs, improving code usability by allowing multiple ways to call a method with different argument combinations. The expansion to the JLS has a more detailed explanation.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is method overriding in Core Java?,"Ans: When discussing basic Java interview questions, it's particularly important to understand method overriding in Java. It occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to customize or extend the behavior of the inherited method. When the overridden method is called on an instance of the subclass, the subclass's implementation is executed instead of its superclass's.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
"). In Core Java, what is the == operator used for when comparing objects?","Ans: Questions in Core Java viva questions may involve operator usage. In Java, the == operator is used for reference comparison. It checks whether two object references point to the same memory location. On the other hand, the .equals() method, when overridden by a class, compares the content or value of objects based on the class's implementation. This allows for custom comparison logic.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is method chaining in Core Java?,"Ans: Design patterns might be explored in interview questions on Java. Method chaining in Core Java is a design pattern where multiple methods are called on an object in a single line, with each method returning the modified object. This pattern provides a way to produce code that is readable and concise since methods can be called in a chain, avoiding the need for intermediate variables.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,AI Engineer,
). How does Core Java support multiple inheritance?,"Ans: When answering Java basic interview questions, it's vital to mention multiple inheritance. Core Java supports multiple inheritance using interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit method signatures (a.k.a., contractual obligations) from multiple sources. This helps evade class inheritance’s associated ambiguity and complexities, since a class can only inherit from one superclass.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is the purpose of the volatile keyword in Core Java?,"Ans: Core Java interview questions and answers often delve into synchronization. In Core Java, the volatile keyword is used to declare a variable as volatile, ensuring that read and write operations of the variable are atomic and immediately visible to all threads. It prohibits individual threads from caching the variable’s value, making it a good fit for variables accessed concurrently by multiple threads.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). Differentiate between the ArrayList and LinkedList in Core Java?,"Ans: Core Java interview questions often involve data structures in Java. The ArrayList and LinkedList both store collections of objects, but they have different underlying data structures and characteristics. The ArrayList is backed by an array, so it’s efficient for random access (get and set operations), but less so for insertions and deletions in the middle of the list. The LinkedList is implemented as a doubly-linked list, so it’s efficient for insertions and deletions in the middle of the list, but less so for random access.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is the hashCode() method used for in Core Java?,"Ans: Core Java interview questions like these are important for any Core Java developer. The hashCode() method in Core Java is used to calculate a hash code value for an object, which is used by data structures like HashSet and HashMap to store and retrieve objects. The default implementation in the Object class returns the memory address of the object in an integer format, but classes can override the method to provide custom hash code implementation.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
"). Explain Reflection in Core Java, its uses and why it’s important?","Ans: Reflection in Core Java is a powerful and advanced feature that allows you to inspect and manipulate classes at runtime even though classes (fields,methods,constructors etc.) are not identified at compile time. The ability to reflect on the code is pivotal for several advanced applications, running frameworks and tools which require to “get information about followed analysis and execution of methods”.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,AI Engineer,
). What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator interfaces in Core Java?,"Ans: The Comparable interface is used for objects of each class that need to be ordered with a single logical ordering, through the use of the compareTo method. By contrast, the Comparator interface is used to define multiple possible orderings for objects by external implementations of the methods, allowing for the flexibility of custom ordering to be provided without modifying the actual class of the object. These concepts forms a critical part of a Core",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
).  How do you handle exceptions in Core Java?,"Ans: Exception handling in Core Java is managed through the use of try, catch, finally blocks, and the throws keyword. The try block encloses the code that might throw an exception, while the catch block is used to handle the exception. The finally block contains code that is always executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. The throws keyword is used in method signatures to indicate that a method might throw one or more exceptions. Proper exception handling is crucial for building robust Java applications and is a common focus in both Core Java learning online platforms and Core Java courses.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is the Double-Checked Locking idiom in Core Java concurrency?,Ans: The Double-Checked Locking idiom reduces the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the lock is actually acquired for real if the locking criterion indicates the lock’s presence). This idiom is often used for lazily initializing the singleton object. It must be implemented with care in Core Java to be thread-safe. Generally it is implemented using volatile variables. It is an advanced concurrency pattern and covered in detail in many of the Core  Java training programs which focuses on design patterns and concurrency.,https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). How do you use the default keyword in Core Java interfaces?,"Ans: The default keyword in Core Java interfaces enables developers to provide method implementations directly within the body of the interface. This feature, introduced in Java 8, effectively allows interfaces to be extended without having to revise every implementing class. The benefit of this is that it permits developers to expand large codebases of interfaces without fear of breaking the old code. Default methods are a common topic of interest in Core Java courses and Core Java training, as they provide a new sense of flexibility and extensibility to what has always been a rigid outline of APIs.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What are some benefits of the Stream API in Core Java for parallel operations?,"Ans: The Core Java Stream API gives developers a way to process viewless collections of objects in a functional manner. The primary advantage of using the Stream API is the ease with which it can be parallelized, allowing for significant performance improvements in a multi-core system. By employing the parallelStream method, the developer can effortlessly transition between sequential and parallel execution modes without modifying the original code structure; the simple act of changing the method call makes the Stream API an effective tool for efficiently handling complex data processing, a theme that is emphasized in Core Java online courses which focus on performance optimization.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Backend Developer,
).  What is type erasure in Core Java Generics?,Ans: Type erasure is a process that is applied by the Core Java compiler in order to apply type constraints at compile time and then remove the generic type information replacing it with non-generic upper bounds (such as Object) and raw types. This means that the information that a generic type used is not available at runtime. The process was introduced to ensure binary backward compatibility with pre-existing versions of Core Java that did not have generics.,https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
Java Memory Leaks and how to avoid them?,"Ans: Core Java memory leaks occur when objects are no longer being used, but cannot be garbage collected because they are still being referenced. Over time, memory leaks can result in an application using an excessive amount of memory, causing performance degradation or crashes. Avoiding memory leaks involves being careful about how long a reference to an object is held, using weak references where appropriate, and always dereferencing an object when it’s no longer needed.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is the role of the @FunctionalInterface annotation in Core Java?,"Ans: The @FunctionalInterface annotation in Core Java is used to indicate that an interface type declaration is intended to be a functional interface, as defined by the Core Java Language Specification. Function interfaces have exactly one abstract method. This is not required, but helps the compiler to understand the intention of the interface. That being said, this area is found to be usually heavily covered in a modern Core Java course, especially those introducing Lambda expressions or Core Java programming with regard to functional programming.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
).  What is the purpose of the @Override annotation in Core Java?,"Ans: The @Override is used in Core Java to indicate that a method you are overriding is intended to actually be an override. That way you can be sure if you’re reading the code of the overriding method because the IDE and compiler can tell you for sure through the presence of the @Override annotation. This will allow for checking errors like misspelling the method name or not correctly matching the method signature, so the programmer can let the compiler find the error.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). How can you achieve thread-safe singleton in Core Java?,"Ans: To achieve thread-safe singleton in Core Java, you can use Bill Pugh Singleton implementation or an enum based singleton. Bill Pugh uses a static inner helper class to hold the singleton instance, creating it only when requested and leveraging Core Java's class loading mechanism for thread safety. Enum based singleton ensures a single instance is created through Core Java's guarantee that any enum constant is instantiated only once in a Core Java program. These design patterns are fundamental to application efficiency and scalability, integral topics in advanced Core Java training.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
Java address it?,"Ans: The Diamond Problem is a multiple inheritance problem that occurs when a class tries to inherit from two classes that have a method with the same signature. Core Java addresses this issue via interfaces, rather than by allowing multiple inheritance of classes. With default methods in interfaces, if a class implements two interfaces that have a default method with the same signature, the class is required to override the method to resolve the ambiguity. This is an important part of the Core Java online course curriculum for beginners, as it illustrates how Core Java deals with object-oriented design.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). How do you use the assert keyword in Core Java and when is it appropriate?,"Ans: The assert keyword in Core Java is used for debugging, to test assumptions about the state of a program. An assertion will throw an AssertionError if the specified condition is false. Assertions are typically used during development and in testing to find and fix errors early in the life cycle. However, it is best practice to handle exceptions for error handling in production code. The use of assertions is a subject that is covered in detail in Core Java courses as developers learn to debug their applications effectively.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is the NavigableSet interface in Core Java?,"Ans: The NavigableSet interface extends the SortedSet interface to provide navigation methods for retrieving elements based on their position in the set. You can, for example, retrieve elements greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, or within a certain range. This interface is a particularly powerful way to work with ordered sets of data.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). How does the forEach method in Core Java 8 enhance collection processing?,"Ans: The forEach method, added in Core Java 8, gives a new, much improved way, to iterating collections using lambda expressions or method references. This provides a more readable, and concise way to iterate the elements of a collection. forEach is defined in the Iterable interface so that you can perform a sequence of elements on every Collection. As a result this new method gives a way to do functional-style operations on every element of a collection.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). How do you differentiate between `static` and `instance` methods in Core Java?,"Ans: In Core Java, `static` methods belong to the class itself and can be called without creating an instance of the class. They can only access static data members and other static methods. Instance methods, on the other hand, require an object of the class to be created and can access both instance and static data members and methods. This distinction is critical for understanding object-oriented programming principles in Core Java, a common area of focus in core java interview questions.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is the significance of the `interface` keyword in Core Java?,"Ans: The `interface` keyword in Core Java is used to define an abstract type that specifies a set of method signatures without providing their implementations. Classes can implement interfaces, thereby agreeing to provide implementations for the abstract methods declared within them. Interfaces support multiple inheritances in Core Java and are a cornerstone of Java's approach to polymorphism and abstraction, topics frequently covered in java interview questions for freshers.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). Can you modify the value of a final variable in Core Java?,"Ans: In Core Java, a `final` variable can only be assigned once, either at the time of declaration or within the constructor. Once assigned, its value cannot be modified, making it effectively a constant. This immutability concept is critical for creating secure, thread-safe code, and is a concept that is often tested in Core Java viva questions.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What are Core Java Packages and how do you use them?,"Ans: Core Java packages are used to group related classes and interfaces, providing a controlled namespace mechanism that helps avoid name clashes.

Understanding how to create and use packages is a basic yet essential part of Java programming, often discussed in core java interview questions.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). How does the `try-catch-finally` block work in Core Java?,"Ans: In Core Java, `try-catch-finally` blocks are used for exception handling. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the `try` block. The `catch` block is used to handle the exception, and the `finally` block contains code that is executed after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. The `finally` block is typically used for resource cleanup activities. This concept is foundational for robust Core Java application development, frequently explored in Core Java interview questions for freshers.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Core Java?,"Ans: In Core Java, `==` is a reference comparison operator that compares whether two references point to the same object in memory. In contrast, the `.equals()` method is intended for content comparison, checking if two objects have the same value. Not all classes override `.equals()`, so its behavior can vary unless specifically implemented. This distinction is crucial for understanding Core Java's comparison mechanisms, a common subject of basic Core java interview questions.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What are wrapper classes in Core Java?,"Ans: Wrapper classes in Core Java provide a way to use primitive data types (int, char, etc.) as objects. The eight primitive data types have corresponding wrapper classes in the `java.lang` package (e.g., `Integer` for `int`, `Character` for `char`, etc.). These classes are essential for working with collections, which can only store objects. Understanding wrapper classes is fundamental for working with Core Java's object-oriented features, often covered in core java interview questions.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,

The finalize() method is a method provided by the Object class, which can be overridden by a class to perform cleanup operations before the object is garbage collected. However, it's not recommended for critical resource management due to uncertainty about when it will be called.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is a lambda expression in Core Java?,Ans. Lambda expressions are a new and important feature included in Core Java SE 8. A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function. It does not have a name; it is used in functional programming; and it can be passed as a parameter to a functional interface like Runnable or Comparator.,https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). How does the static keyword affect memory management in Core Java?,"Ans. The static keyword in Java indicates that a specific field or method is a class field. With no objects necessary you can call them. A static field or method is created once, and is shared among all instances of the class. It can contribute to effective memory management in large applications, particularly in the context of Java learning online, where static fields can improve manageability. They are used judiciously as they promote reusability and avoid redundancy of instance variables and instance methods.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What are the benefits of using Stream API in Core Java 8 for data processing?,"Ans. The Stream API introduced in Java 8 is a major advancement in the Java programming language, enabling more expressive and, perhaps more importantly, more efficient data processing. Streams represent a new abstraction on collections, supporting a more expressive and declarative approach to collections processing (including support of operations like filter, map, reduce, and collect). This allows developers to write more readable and more concise code for common operations that involve collections. For this reason, Stream API tends to be the focus of many articles, blogs, and Java training courses for advanced Java learning online. In addition to promoting the functional programming principles of Java, it can offer significant performance improvements to Java applications through parallelization of operations on collections.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Backend Developer,
). How do you manage memory leaks in Core Java applications?,"Ans. Memory leaks in Java can be managed by ensuring that objects are no longer referenced when they need to be. You might use tools such as 'jmap', 'jhat', 'jstack', and 'jconsole' to identify objects that are not being garbage collected. As these objects do not show up in the heap finder, these tools can be very useful to find where possible memory leaks are within the Java application. Also object finalization in Java can be used to remove unnecessary object references. other techniques involve using a profiler and writing efficient code; using a weak reference can also be handy. Also remember that class loader is a potential source of memory leaks in J2EE. You can explore more with Java online courses. And it is definitely one of the favorite Java interview questions.",https://www.janbasktraining.com/blog/core-java-interview-questions-answers/,Software Engineer,
). What is the difference between ExecutorService and Fork/Join Framework in Core Java?,"Ans. The ExecutorService is a framework provided by the Java concurrency API that simplifies the execution of tasks in asynchronous mode. It provides a pool of threads for executing Runnable and Callable tasks. On the other hand, the Fork/Join Framework, introduced in Java 7, is designed to efficiently handle a large number of tasks.

"What is Reinforcement learning, and how does it work?","Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning which works on reward-based models for prediction and decision making. It deploys a feedback-based mechanism to reward a machine when it makes good decisions. Negative feedback is provided to the machine when it does not perform well. This encourages the machine to find the best possible behavior in a particular situation. Unlike supervised learning, the agent learns autonomously utilizing feedback and no labelled data in Reinforcement Learning. Because there is no labeled data, the agent must rely only on its own experience to learn.  RL is used to tackle a certain sort of problem in which sequential decision-making is required and the aim is long-term, such as game-playing, robotics, and so on. The agent interacts with and explores the world on its own. In reinforcement learning, an agent's primary goal is to increase performance by obtaining the most positive rewards.
