Java Memory Leaks and how to avoid them?,"Ans: Core Java memory leaks occur when objects are no longer being used, but cannot be garbage collected because they are still being referenced. Over time, memory leaks can result in an application using an excessive amount of memory, causing performance degradation or crashes. Avoiding memory leaks involves being careful about how long a reference to an object is held, using weak references where appropriate, and always dereferencing an object when it’s no longer needed.","Ans: Core Java memory leaks occur when objects are no longer being used, but cannot be garbage collected because they are still being referenced.

). What are the benefits of using Stream API in Core Java 8 for data processing?,"Ans. The Stream API introduced in Java 8 is a major advancement in the Java programming language, enabling more expressive and, perhaps more importantly, more efficient data processing. Streams represent a new abstraction on collections, supporting a more expressive and declarative approach to collections processing (including support of operations like filter, map, reduce, and collect). This allows developers to write more readable and more concise code for common operations that involve collections. For this reason, Stream API tends to be the focus of many articles, blogs, and Java training courses for advanced Java learning online. In addition to promoting the functional programming principles of Java, it can offer significant performance improvements to Java applications through parallelization of operations on collections.","Ans.
